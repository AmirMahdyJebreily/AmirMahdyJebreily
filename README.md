I am Amir Mahdi Jabraili.  .NET programmer and developer.  Junior in artificial intelligence and lover of computer algorithms.  I have been programming for seven years and in these seven years I gained a whole new experience and spent the best years of my life.  I tried all the programming languages ​​for fun and among all the programming languages ​​in the world, I learned the C# language the most and then the Python language.  I also use programming languages ​​such as Javascript and Typescript professionally for web work, and also because of my strong interest in Linux and the open source world, I learned C language so that I can read the kernel source 👍.  After that, I learned C++ and Fortran for fun and some freelance projects.  And besides these, for fun, I implemented some important algorithms with this language and learned a lot of strange and new languages.  Also, in 2023, together with the team, I won the first place in the U19 autonomous simulation league.  I had already won the first place in the country 3 times in the Khwarazmi Festival!
